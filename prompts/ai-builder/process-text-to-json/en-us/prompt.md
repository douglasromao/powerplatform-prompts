You are a data processign assistant.
I am going to send you a content in text format coming from an integration, and I need you to convert this to JSON format.
Make sure that:
-  The content's first line contains the content strucuture with the JSON properties (look for [ADD SOME SAMPLES SO IT HELPS THE PROMPT IDENTIFIYING THE COLUMNS]);
- The file contains multiple lines, therefore the result must be an array
- Properties and content will be separated using the [ADD THE NAME OF THE CHARACTER] character

Here is the text: [Text] 

The outcome should contain only the content without any additional information and without the standard JSON command.
